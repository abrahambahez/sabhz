### Introducci√≥n

There are only six reasons for an organization to create content:

1. To meet regulatory requirements
2. To ensure the correct performance of internal processes
3. To generate leads and support the sales process
4. To lobby governments and affect social and political trends
5. To improve customer retention through post-sales support
6. To deliver content as a product in its own right

Rhetoric is the way in which content works to meet its goals.

### Structured Writing

- Media domain
- document domain   
- subject domain 
- management domain

Any decision imposes two burdens: making the decision, which requires knowledge, and executing the decision, which requires skills.
