I began by making WordPress sites, soon learned HTML, CSS & JS. Now I'm trying to migrate all my work to the [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/). Here is the list of sites I'm actually responsible for:

* [BCIE](http://www.bciestructural.com/), a civil engineering independent firm
* [RMA](http://rma.mx/), an account services provider
* [All About Greece](https://itsallaboutgreece.com/en), a blog run by people who discovered the Greek Dream
* This site, which is opensource and you can find in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/abrahambahez/sabhz)
