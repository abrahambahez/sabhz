I'm Sergio, an interdisciplinary facilitator moving between design, technology, communication and sociocultural research. Currently I'm a Product Manager at [KarmaPulse](https://www.karmapulse.com/); but also [I'm always engaged with multiple side projects](present).

I try to learn new things using a Project-Based approach. This website is aimed to documenting and sharing all that stuff. In the Spanish version I'm also sharing my mental garden.

Welcome.
