I'm Sergio, an interdisciplinary facilitator moving between design, technology, communication and sociocultural research. I'm a Product Manager at [KarmaPulse](https://www.karmapulse.com/); also I've [design & code some websites](websites)
as a freelancer. I've created and begin to test a communication strategy methodology (coming soon in this site).

I'm always trying to learn new things using a Project-Based approach. This website is aimed to documenting and sharing all that stuff. In the Spanish version I'm also sharing my mental garden.

Welcome.
