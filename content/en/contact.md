If you have something to say, please write me using this address:

<a href="mailto:tacto@sabhz.com" style="text-align:center;">tacto@sabhz.com</a>

'Tacto' is the spanish word for 'tact'. It's meant to be a pun for the typical 'contact' mail thing.

I don't like to think that email has to be the *annoying spammy stuff* it is nowadays. Rather, I prefer the historical approach: the heir of the noble tradition of writing letters. If you're going to send me an email, please consider that vision first.
