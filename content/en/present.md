I'm working on the texts that will be published soon in this website. 

I'm passionate about *knowledge management systems*, so I'm trying to implement one in [KarmaPulse](https://www.karmapulse.com/).

I'm designing and coding the blog [All About Greece](https://itsallaboutgreece.com/en), a site that teaches you how to live the Greek Dream

I'm pursuit a PhD in Anthropology at [UADY](https://www.uady.mx/), in Yucat√°n, Mexico.

I'm learning [Python](https://www.python.org/) & [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) programming languages.
